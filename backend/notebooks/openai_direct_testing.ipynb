      "Groundwater inundation is a type of flooding that happens when rising sea levels cause the groundwater to rise to the surface. In Hawaii, this can be a significant issue because many areas are low-lying and close to the ocean.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Projected Impacts:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Increased Flooding:** As sea levels rise, groundwater levels also rise, which can lead to flooding in areas that might not be directly on the coast. This means that even if your home isn't right next to the ocean, it could still be at risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Infrastructure Damage:** Roads, buildings, and other infrastructure could be damaged by the rising groundwater. This is because water can weaken foundations and cause structural issues over time.\n",

      "3. **Agricultural Impact:** Farmland could be affected as rising groundwater can lead to saltwater intrusion, which can harm crops and reduce agricultural productivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Water Quality Issues:** Rising groundwater can also lead to contamination of freshwater supplies, as saltwater mixes with freshwater aquifers.\n",

      "- Low-lying areas in Honolulu, Waikiki, and other coastal communities on Oahu are particularly vulnerable.\n",

      "With 3 feet of sea level rise, Honolulu and Waikiki could experience several types of flooding. Here's a breakdown:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Passive Marine Flooding**: This is when the ocean water directly floods the land as sea levels rise. In areas like Waikiki, which are close to the shore, this could mean more frequent and severe flooding during high tides.\n",

      "2. **Groundwater Inundation**: As sea levels rise, the groundwater table can also rise. In low-lying areas, this might cause flooding from below, where water seeps up through the ground.\n",

      "3. **Low-Lying Flooding**: Areas that are already at or near sea level, like parts of Waikiki, are particularly vulnerable. With 3 feet of sea level rise, these areas could be regularly flooded, especially during storms or high tides.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Compound Flooding**: This occurs when multiple types of flooding happen at the same time. For example, a high tide combined with a storm surge could lead to more extensive flooding.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Drainage Backflow**: With higher sea levels, storm drains and sewers might not work as effectively, leading to water backing up and causing flooding in streets and neighborhoods.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Coastal Roads and Highways**: Many of Hawaii's roads, especially those along the coast, are at risk. Rising sea levels can lead to more frequent flooding and erosion, which can damage roadways and disrupt transportation. For example, parts of the H-1 Freeway in Honolulu and the Kamehameha Highway on Oahu are particularly vulnerable.\n",

      "2. **Airports**: Some of Hawaii's airports, like Honolulu International Airport, are located near the coast and could be affected by rising sea levels and increased flooding. This could impact travel and the transportation of goods.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Harbors and Ports**: As vital hubs for shipping and receiving goods, Hawaii's ports, such as Honolulu Harbor, are crucial. Rising sea levels could affect their operations, leading to economic impacts.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Water and Sewage Systems**: Infrastructure for water supply and sewage treatment is often located near the coast. Rising sea levels can lead to saltwater intrusion into freshwater supplies and overwhelm sewage systems, causing backflow and contamination.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Tourism Facilities**: Hotels, resorts, and other tourism-related infrastructure along the coast are at risk. This is significant for Hawaii's economy, which heavily relies on tourism.\n",

      "When these two types of flooding happen at the same time, it can create a \"compound flooding\" scenario. This means that areas that might normally handle one type of flooding could be overwhelmed when both occur together. For example, during a high tide or storm surge, the ocean water can push into the storm drain system, reducing its capacity to handle rainwater. This can lead to more extensive and deeper flooding in urban areas.\n",

      "================================================================================\n",
      "Flooding is a big concern, especially if you live in a coastal area like Hawaii, because it can have a major impact on your home, community, and daily life. Here’s why it’s important to pay attention:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Rising Sea Levels**: As the climate warms, sea levels are rising. This means that areas that are currently dry could be underwater in the future. For example, some projections suggest that sea levels could rise by several feet by the end of the century, which could flood low-lying areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Coastal Erosion**: Rising seas and stronger storms can lead to erosion, which means beaches and shorelines are wearing away. This can threaten homes and infrastructure near the coast.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Groundwater Issues**: In some places, rising sea levels can push groundwater up to the surface, causing flooding from below. This is a particular concern in flat, low-lying areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Storm Surges and High Waves**: During storms, high waves and storm surges can cause temporary but severe flooding. This is especially true during hurricanes or other major storm events.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Infrastructure Impact**: Flooding can damage roads, bridges, and buildings, leading to costly repairs and disruptions in daily life. It can also affect utilities like water and electricity.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Environmental and Health Concerns**: Flooding can lead to water contamination, which poses health risks. It can also harm local ecosystems and wildlife.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Hawaii, places like Waikiki in Honolulu or parts of Maui are particularly vulnerable due to their low elevation and proximity to the ocean. While scientists are working hard to predict and mitigate these impacts, it's important for residents to stay informed and prepared. If you live in a flood-prone area, it might be a good idea to have a plan in place for potential flooding events.\n"

      "   - **Passive Marine Flooding**: Shows areas that might flood as sea levels rise.\n",
      "   - **Groundwater Inundation**: Highlights places where rising groundwater could cause flooding.\n",
      "   - **Low-Lying Flooding**: Identifies low-elevation areas at risk.\n",
      "   - **Future Erosion Hazard Zone**: Displays areas where the shoreline might erode.\n",
      "   - **Annual High Wave Flooding**: Indicates places that could flood from big waves.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Explore the Map**: Once you've selected the layers, you can explore the map to see how these risks might affect your home or community. You can zoom in and out and click on different areas for more details.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Understand the Impacts**: Look at how close these risks are to important places like your home, roads, or schools. This can help you understand what might be affected by flooding.\n",
