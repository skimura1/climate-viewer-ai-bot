       "  'description': 'Groundwater Inundation (GWI) refers to flooding that occurs as groundwater is lifted above the elevation of the ground surface and/or buried infrastructure. GWI is one of the more difficult flood mechanisms to manage owing to its ability to evade coastal defenses designed to mitigate direct marine flooding (e.g., seawalls, revetments, and other methods of shoreline hardening). Simulations of groundwater levels within the Koʻolaupoko Moku makai of the 10m elevation contour were produced using a 3D numerical model (MODFLOW). The methodology for model construction was based on Habel et al. (2017) and was further expanded in accordance with Habel et al. (2020) and by incorporating aquifer drain modeling in alignment with Whittier et al. (2009). Calibration included comparing the model’s outputs with 86 discrete water-level observations from the Hawai’i Department of Health Leaky Underground Storage Tank records, five discrete water level observations from Ghazal et al. (2023), and five sets of continuous monitoring data obtained as part of ongoing monitoring efforts in the Ko‘olaupoko Moku region. Following calibration, the simulated mean residual water level and root-mean-squared error were 0.09 m and 0.30 m, respectively. Steady-state groundwater levels were simulated, considering one foot increments of sea level rise up to 10 ft. Areas vulnerable to GWI were identified through a comparison of simulated water table elevations to a DEM. Flood depths were calculated where the simulated water table exceeds ground surface, and depths to groundwater where the opposite occurred. The total vertical error in GWI simulation, considering LiDAR and calibrated MODFLOW errors, was measured at 0.42 meters.',\n",

       "  'description': 'Groundwater Inundation (GWI) refers to flooding that occurs when groundwater levels rise above the ground surface and/or buried infrastructure. Managing GWI presents significant challenges, as it can bypass coastal defense systems designed to mitigate direct marine flooding, such as seawalls, revetments, and other forms of shoreline hardening. Model Development and MethodologySimulations of the shallowing of the unsaturated zone and increased groundwater emergence under scenarios of sea-level rise were initially developed based on the methodologies outlined by Habel et al. (2017) and were subsequently expanded in accordance with Habel et al. (2020). In 2023, simulations for the Primary Urban Core (PUC) were updated to integrate additional data from monitoring efforts in Waikīkī, supported by the Honolulu Board of Water Supply.For the Ko‘olaupoko and Ko‘olauloa moku, and updates to modeling for the PUC domain, model methodologies were refined by incorporating aquifer drain modeling in alignment with Whittier et al. (2009). Drains were used to improve the simulation of streams across the study areas, following Whittier et al. (2010) and Izuka et al. (2023). Instead of the standard drain package, the drain return package was employed to more realistically simulate the partial influx of water into coastal aquifers from basal aquifers via stream channels.3D Model ConstructionThe method employs MODFLOW-2005, a three-dimensional finite-difference flow model, to simulate steady-state water table conditions under various magnitudes of sea-level rise. Subsurface hydrogeologic conditions were modeled based on findings from regional studies. The model comprises layers representing caprock and basal basalt hydrogeological units. Pumping well locations and withdrawal rates, as provided by the State Commission on Water Resource Management, were adopted from existing groundwater-flow models representative of the respective aquifer. Only wells extracting water from the caprock aquifer were considered in the simulations. Recharge data were derived from a mean annual water-budget model for the Island of O‘ahu, Hawai‘i. This model accounts for hydrological processes such as rainfall, fog interception, evapotranspiration, direct runoff, irrigation, and return flow from septic systems. Seaward of the 0-meter land-surface elevation contour, mean sea level conditions were simulated using a specified general-head boundary at the ocean bottom, with a conductance of 10 m²/day and a general-head elevation of 0 meters.Model CalibrationCalibration was performed by comparing model outputs to discrete water-level observations from the Hawai‘i Department of Health’s Leaky Underground Storage Tank records and regional monitoring efforts. Observations were corrected for tidal influence and anomalous sea-surface heights using methods from Habel et al. (2017). The nonlinear inverse modeling tool, PEST, with Tikhonov preferred homogeneous regularization, was used to estimate hydraulic conductivity for caprock layers. Zonal PEST was applied instead of pilot points to avoid overfitting. Post-calibration hydraulic conductivity values for the respective zones aligned with observed ranges in each study area. Additionally, wetlands identified via satellite imagery were used as a calibration metric, as they represent the surface expression of the water table. This method was particularly valuable in the Ko‘olaupoko and Ko‘olauloa moku, where discrete measurements are sparse, but wetlands are abundant.Simulation of Sea Level Rise Sea-level rise was simulated by adjusting the general-head boundary to match the specified increase. For instance, a 1 ft rise in mean sea level was simulated by setting the general-head value to 1 ft. The landward extent of the general-head boundary was re-evaluated to reflect the land-surface elevation contour corresponding to the simulated sea-level rise.Calculation of Tidal InfluenceGroundwater-level oscillations are attenuated relative to ocean water levels, with increased temporal lag and decreased amplitude inland. Tidal influence was quantified by cross-correlating tidal signals from the nearest NOAA tide station with observed groundwater data. Tidal efficiency was calculated through linear regression of lag-corrected groundwater time series against tidal signal data.Production of Flood MapsFlood maps were produced by comparing simulated water table elevations, including tidal influence, to a Digital Elevation Model (DEM). Flood depths were calculated where the simulated water table exceeded the ground surface, while depths to groundwater were calculated where the opposite occurred.Simulation Uncertainty Uncertainty in GWI simulations was quantified for each modeling domain:Honolulu PUC: Mean residual water level: 0.09 m; Root-mean-squared error: 0.12 m; Total vertical error considering the quadrature sum of LiDAR and calibrated MODFLOW errors: 0.32 m.Ko‘olaupoko moku: Mean residual water level: 0.09 m; Root-mean-squared error: 0.30 m; Total vertical error considering the quadrature sum of LiDAR and calibrated MODFLOW errors: 0.42 m.Ko‘olauloa moku: Mean residual water level: 0.25 m; Root-mean-squared error: 0.51 m; Total vertical error considering the quadrature sum of LiDAR and calibrated MODFLOW errors: 0.60 m.Limitations of the Groundwater ModelLimitations of the modeling approach are detailed in Habel et al (2017) in which main limitations include: The model is steady-state and thus does not assess time-dependent processes (i.e., variations in boundary flows, recharge, pumping rates, and groundwater storage, aperiodic short-term changes in sea level by phenomena such as tsunamis, storm-surges, etc.); MODFLOW-2005 assumes uniform density of water, and thus does not assess the influence of density-driven fluid flow including mixed seawater and freshwater flows; The model does not consider the following: flow that occurs in the unsaturated zone, surface-water flow, evaporation from surface-water sources, ponding or routing of waters that occurs once groundwater breaches the ground surface, dynamic changes in landscape (i.e., erosion).',\n",

       " 'drainage_backflow': {'title': 'Drainage Backflow',\n",
       "  'description': \"Storm-drain backflow is similar to direct marine flooding, as both involve flood waters originating from the ocean. However, storm-drain backflow specifically occurs due to the presence of gravity-flow drainage networks, which are commonly used in coastal cities globally. These drainage systems rely on differences in elevation between the drainage and outflow areas (ocean waters). In coastal regions with lower elevations, high tides can decrease these elevation differences, leading to a potential slowdown or even reversal of drainage.Methods: Areas prone to flooding due to storm-drain backflow were identified using a modified version of the bathtub approach. This method was adapted to exclude flooded regions lacking direct surface connections to drainage systems. Exclusions were implemented for flood areas not interfacing with drainage infrastructure, based on the assumption that such areas wouldn't experience drainage-facilitated flooding. To identify locations where drainage infrastructure facilitates water flow from the marine environment, we use geospatial data that characterize drainage inlet locations. These datasets, endorsed by the responsible agency, have high confidence in the spatial accuracy of the data such that it is extensively used for planning, management, and operational decision-making.Note that groundwater contributions were not considered in the simulation of storm-drain backflow. Additionally, dynamic effects, such as variations in flow rate due to conduit radii (i.e. pipe size), were omitted from the simulation. This omission may produce a slight overestimation in simulated flood depth and area since water is assumed to be able to flow unrestricted.Hawaiʻi i is exposed to large waves annually on all open coasts due to our location in the Central North Pacific Ocean. The distance over which waves run-up and wash across the shoreline will increase with sea level rise. As water levels increase, less wave energy will be dissipated through breaking on nearshore reefs and waves will arrive at a higher elevation at the shoreline.Computer model simulations of future annual high wave flooding were conducted by the Coastal Geology Group at UH SOEST using methods described in Anderson et al. 2018. The model propagates the maximum annually recurring wave, calculated from offshore wave buoy data, over the reef and to the shore along one-dimensional (1D) cross-shore profiles extracted from a 1-meter DEM. Profiles are spaced 20 meters apart along the coast. This approach was used to model the transformation of the wave as it breaks across the reef and includes shallow water wave processes such as wave set-up and overtopping. The RCP8.5 scenario was used to model exposure to sea level rise of 1 - 10 feet.annual high wave flooding schematic (https://www.pacioos.hawaii.edu/shoreline/slr-hawaii/)Figure 6. Schematic diagram showing key inputs and outputs of modeling annual high wave flooding.Historical data used to model annual high wave flooding include hourly measurements of significant wave height, peak wave period, and peak wave direction, and was acquired from offshore wave buoy data from PacIOOS. Maximum surface elevation and depth of the annual high wave flooding is calculated from the mean of the five highest modeled water elevations at each model location along each profile. Output from the simulations is interpolated between transects and compiled in a 5-meter map grid. Depth grid cells with values less than 10 centimeters are not included in the impact assessment. This was done to remove very thin layers of water excursions that (1) are beyond the accuracy of the model and (2) might not constitute a significant impact to land and resources when only occurring once annually. Any low-lying flooded areas that are not connected to the ocean are also removed.Assumptions and Limitations: Annual high wave flood modeling covered wave-exposed coasts with low-lying development on Maui, Oʻahu, and Kauaʻi. Annual high wave flooding was not available for the islands of Hawaiʻi, Molokaʻi, and Lānaʻi, nor for some harbors or other back-bay areas throughout all the islands. Additional studies would be needed to add the annual high wave flooding for those areas. The maximum annually recurring wave parameters (significant wave height, period, direction) were statistically determined using historical wave climate records and do not include potential changes in future wave climate, the effects of storm surge, or less-frequent high wave events (e.g., a 1-in-10 year wave event). In some locations, the extent of flooding modeled was limited by the extent of the 1-meter DEM.Changes in shoreline location due to coastal erosion are not included in this modeling. As shorelines retreat, annual high wave flooding will reach farther inland along retreating shorelines. Waves are propagated along a “bare earth” DEM which is void of shoreline structures, buildings, and vegetation, and waves are assumed to flow over an impermeable surface. The DEM represents a land surface at one particular time, and may not be representative of the beach shape during the season of most severe wave impact, particularly for highly variable north and west-exposed beaches.Undesirable artifacts of 1D modeling include over-predicted flooding along some transects with deep, shore-perpendicular indentations in the sea bottom such as nearshore reef channels (see Figure 4, above). The 1D modeling does not account for the presence of nearby shallow reef which refracts and dissipates some of the wave energy traveling through the channel toward the shore. Wave flooding modeling may be improved in future efforts by employing more complex and data-intensive 2D modeling and through local field experiments. In addition, mapping errors may be found in some areas due to clipping (subsetting) of the original map layers using a shoreline (Special Management Area) boundary (see Figure 4, above).\",\n",

       "  'description': 'Hawaiʻi is exposed to large waves annually on all open coasts due to our location in the Central North Pacific Ocean. The distance over which waves run-up and wash across the shoreline will increase with sea level rise. As water levels increase, less wave energy will be dissipated through breaking on nearshore reefs and waves will arrive at a higher elevation at the shoreline. We use the phase-resolving numerical model Boussinesq Ocean and Surf Zone (BOSZ) to simulate wave-driven flooding for annually-recurring wave conditions under a range of SLR levels. Modeling the annually-recurring wave conditions is relevant to this modeling effort since it represents wave conditions that, on average, could occur in any given year. The simulations are done over a high resolution (5 m x 5 m horizontal grid spacing) digital surface model, and the final product is projected onto a 2 m x 2 m grid. Histograms of wave directions generated by lengthy hindcast records (40-yr-long) are used to determine the dominant wave directions that need to be modeled. Our directional bands are 30-degrees wide (+/- 15 deg). If for a given domain we clearly identify multiple wave directions from which the wave amplitudes are sufficiently high, we will run our model simulations separately for each of these wave directions. The annually-recurring wave height is determined from a Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) analysis. All simulations use the MHHW tidal datum. We directly calculate the MHHW from a lengthy (18.6-yr-long) record of water level at the nearest tide gauge. Sea level rise scenarios (0-10ft) are added as a water state assuming the same tidal epoch and wave direction and amplitudes. Each SLR value requires a separate model simulation.The flood depth at a given grid cell is the mean of the five highest water depth values out of the entire simulation.',\n",

       "  'description': \"Heavy rainfall events in Hawai’i produce widespread flooding, power outages, road closures and property damage. In the coastal zone, these impacts are exacerbated by climate change due to the compound effects of sea level rise and the likelihood of more intense storms reaching the islands. The team simulates the inundation associated with future flood events to help inform climate-related policy and mitigation strategies. The team is implementing an expanded version of the Weather Research and Forecasting Hydrological (WRF-Hydro) modeling system, developed for coastal-urban flood applications (WRF-Hydro-CUFA), for event specific domains in Hawai'i. The dynamical model will be validated with historical heavy rainfall events such as Kona lows, upper tropospheric troughs, tropical cyclones, and cold fronts. Combining modeled precipitation events with scenarios of sea level rise allows the team to simulate future flooding and to identify areas at risk of compound flooding. This is exciting and challenging work given Hawai‘i’s complex terrain, limited domain size, and lack of available observations. Despite this multifaceted challenge, the team is making progress in creating high resolution hydrological modeling systems for the region.\",\n",
